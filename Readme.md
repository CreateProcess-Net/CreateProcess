# FluentProcess - A simple and powerful Process library for C#

## Examples


## Why?

- I'm the creator of the rock solid foundation used by the [FAKE](https://fake.build)-Build system
- I always wanted to build a simple layer on top of the `CreateProcess` API in FAKE.
- The API is now C# first as C# has imho catched up with F#
- Fully unit-testable API
- Design the API to be as typed and as composable as possible


## Alternatives

- https://github.com/madelson/MedallionShell - Another well designed general purpose library
- https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliWrap - Very powerful/good abstractions. If you are doing shell work this one might be worth a look.
- https://github.com/mayuki/Chell - Again shell-based, if you do shell work take a look.
- https://github.com/Cysharp/ProcessX - A bit limited in what you can do
- https://github.com/jamesmanning/RunProcessAsTask - also quite limited
- https://github.com/twitchax/Sheller
